# Weathers-R-Us

## Description
Weather sites are like New York City, they have too many flashing lights and distractions. Look no further! This weather website will give you the current weather for the city of your choosing, without any advertisements! It's as simple as typing in the city you would like to check and clicking "Search". 

I built this project because weather websites have too much extra stuff, it's like they almost forgot about the "meat and potatoes" of searching for weather forecasts.. just the plain old weather! My website is just that; plain old weather.
